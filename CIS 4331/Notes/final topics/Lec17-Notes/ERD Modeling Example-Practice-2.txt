ERD Modeling Example Practice 2:

Develop the ERD Model based on the following requirements about courses and their offerings.

-------------
For each course, the database keeps track of a unique course id, course title, and the number of credits.

Each course has at least one course section and can have many course sections.

Each course section is for exactly one course.

For each course section, the database keeps track of a section id.

Different courses may have the same course section id.

For a particular course, the sections have different section ids.
