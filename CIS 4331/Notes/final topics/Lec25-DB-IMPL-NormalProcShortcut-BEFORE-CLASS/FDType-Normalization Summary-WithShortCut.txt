Functional Dependency Type Summary

 Partial FD: only in table with composite PK
    part of PK alone (& NOT entire PK) --> col1, col2, ...
    Examples:
       ACID -> ACName, SDate, Duration, CMID, CMName
       MID -> Media, Range

 Full FD:
    entire PK & no part of PK alone --> col1, col2,...

    Example:
         ACID, MID -->  BudgetPct


 Transitive  FD:
    non-PK --> non-key col1, non-key col2, ...
    
    Example:  
         CMID -->     CMName

Normalization Process (From 1NF) Shortcut Summary:



1. Correctly identify functional dependency (FD) sets 
   and prune any FD that is trivial, augmented, or equivalent.

   Example:
      
   determinant   
    CMID      -->     CMName      
    ACID      -->     ACName, SDate, Duration, CMID, CMName
    MID       -->     Media, Range
    ACID, MID -->     BudgetPct  

2. Remove overlapping non-key column from the FD set 
        that contains this non-key column and its determinant.
 
   Example:
      
   determinant   
    CMID      -->     CMName      
    ACID      -->     ACName, SDate, Duration, CMID
    MID       -->     Media, Range
    ACID, MID -->     BudgetPct     

3. Create a relation from each FD set and mark the determinant of the FD set
      as the primary key of the relation.
   If the primary key of a relation is a non-primary-key column in another relation,
         then the same colulmn in the second relation is a foreign key 
             referencing the primary key in the first relation.
   Each resulting relation is in 3NF.

   Example:

 Table:  CAMPMGR
   CMID, CMName 
   ----
    PK

 Table: ADCAMPAIGN
     ACID, ACName, SDate, Duration, CMID(FK)
     ----
      PK    
    
    CMID in Table: ADCAMPAIGN is a foreign key
       referencing the primary key CMID in Table: CAMPMGR.

 Table: MODE
    MID, Media, Range
    ---
    PK

 Table: ADCAMPAIGNMIX
   ACID(FK), MID(FK), BudgetPct
   -------------------
       PK

     ACID in Table: ADCAMPAIGNMIX is a foreign key
       referencing the primary key ACID in Table: ADCAMPAIGN.

     MID in Table: ADCAMPAIGNMIX is a foreign key
       referencing the primary key MID in Table: MODE.
