  Does not contain answers to questions about update anomaly.

=======
Short Notations Used:

AID: AirlineID
AName: AirlineName
TID: TerminalID
NoGates: NumberOfGates
NoDFlights: NumberOfDepartingFlights


=======

1. 
Initial Set of Functional Dependencies

  AID --> AName, TID, NoGates

  TID --> NoGates
   
  Date, AID --> AName, TID, NoGates, NoDFights

  It's ok if you have this one below in your initial set. IF you don't, it's better. 
      AID, TID --> AName, NoGates
  
=======

2. 
Pruned Set of Functional Dependencies 
   Remove augmented functional dependencies.
   There are no equivalent or trial functional dependencies.

  Date, AID --> NoDFights

  AID --> AName, TID, NoGates

  TID --> NoGates
  

************** Normalize the set in 2. to 3NF ****************

3. 
Types of FDs (Full, Partial, Transitive):

 Full:  Date, AID --> NoDFights
    
 Partial
  AID --> AName, TID, NoGates
  
 Transitive
  TID --> NoGates

4. 
 AIRPORT_MIX table: already in 1NF, but NOT 2NF

=======
5. 
 Normalize AIRPORT_MIX table to 2NF

 Remove partial FD:
    Partial
      AID --> AName, TID, NoGates 

 Results:
   New Table: AIRLINE_TERMINAL_MIX (in 2NF, NOT 3NF)

6.
 Normalize tables from 5. to 3NF

  Table: AIRPORT_MIX: already in 3NF, no change.

  Normalize table AIRLINE_TERMINAL_MIX to 3NF:

   Remove transitive FD set:
     Transitive 
       TID --> NoGates    

   Result:
     New table: TERMINAL  3NF
          TID, NoGates 
          ---
           PK

         Full:  TID --> NoGates  

     Table: AIRLINE_TERMINAL_MIX (better to rename it to AIRLINE)

Final Result:

**   New Table: TERMINAL,  3NF
